# Suffix-Tree
A Suffix Tree implementation. Linear space. Linear time.

A tutorial and explanation is included as the PDF so others can better understand how and why this data structure works.

The method presented is the McCreight algorithm which I believe to be the easiest to understand. With a minimum of effort it can be transformed into Ukkonen's method (to take advantage of the online property), and the necessary changes are explained in the Conclusion of the PDF.

While the Weiner method is the original, it is not as easily understood as the others and so not shown or detailed except in passing.
